# Sandbox

A collection of experimental code, learning exercises, and quick prototypes.

## What's Here

This repository contains various small projects and experiments.
I intend to keep exploring and adding codes to this repository as I keep learning.

## Purpose

This is a **sandbox repository** - a space for:
- 🧪 Quick experiments and prototypes
- 📚 Learning new concepts and algorithms
- 🔬 Testing ideas before they become full projects
- 💡 Code snippets and one-off scripts

Code here may be rough, incomplete, or purely educational. When projects mature, they graduate to dedicated repositories.
